History Quiz App is a simple and engaging Android app built in Kotlin that tests your knowledge with quick histoty questions that you get options to choose the correct answer. It features a clean user interface with an Ancient Egypt theme to make learning more fun.

When you open the app, you’re welcomed with a short introduction and a “Start Quiz” button. Once the quiz begins, you’re presented with 5 questions, one at a time. You answer by choosing the correct answer whereas you are given four options to choose and you must choose the correct one, and your score is updated based on correct answers.

After completing all questions, the app takes you to a Score Screen, where you can view your final score along with encouraging feedback. From there, you can choose to restart the quiz or (optionally) review your answers.

The app is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and a great tool for both fun and educational purposes. It demonstrates key Android concepts like Activity navigation, Intents, View binding, and user input handling.
